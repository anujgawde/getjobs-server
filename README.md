## How it works

1.  User enters an email on the home page.
2.  The backend checks if the user is already verified:
    - If verified, the user is redirected to the jobs page.
    - If not verified, an email with a verification link is sent.
3.  Once the user verifies their email, they can perform job searches.
4.  The backend checks if the user has already made three searches in a day:
    - If yes, no more searches are allowed until the next day.
    - If no, the search proceeds.
5.  Job listings are fetched from LinkedIn's API, which returns an HTML response.
6.  The backend parses the HTML to extract relevant job details based on the user's filters.
7.  The backend caches job search results for one hour to optimize performance and reduce API calls.
8.  An Excel file is generated with the extracted job details.
9.  The userâ€™s search query is saved in the database for data analysis.

## Features

- Generates an Excel file containing job details:
  - Job ID
  - Job Title
  - Company
  - Location
  - Date Posted
  - Salary
  - Job Link
- Provides users with a downloadable report.

### Search History Storage
